## Why FlareScript?

In the evolving world of Web3 and blockchain, developers face challenges with complex programming languages and high gas costs. FlareScript is designed to address these challenges by providing:

- **Ease of Use**: Minimal code syntax makes blockchain development accessible to both beginners and experienced developers.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Deploy smart contracts across multiple blockchains without needing to rewrite your code.
- **Optimized for Gas Efficiency**: FlareScript includes built-in mechanisms to minimize gas fees, making dApps more cost-effective.
- **Declarative UI Framework**: Build fully functional decentralized applications with an integrated UI framework.
- **AI-Powered Code Suggestions**: Utilize AI to suggest code snippets and optimize performance as you write.

## Key Features

- **Minimal-Code Syntax**: Write smart contracts with fewer lines of code.
- **Cross-Chain Deployment**: Easily deploy your dApps on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and other blockchains.
- **Gas Optimization**: Built-in functions to reduce gas usage in smart contracts.
- **Secure by Default**: Includes built-in security checks for common vulnerabilities.
- **Declarative UI**: FlareScript’s declarative framework allows you to create intuitive UIs for dApps effortlessly.
- **AI-Powered Suggestions**: An intelligent coding assistant that helps you write and optimize your code.

## Architecture

FlareScript is divided into several key components:
- **Core Language**: Written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), which compiles to WebAssembly (Wasm) for efficient execution.
- **CLI Tool**: Built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for managing smart contract deployment and dApp creation.
- **Declarative UI Framework**: A simple yet powerful UI framework designed to integrate seamlessly with blockchain technologies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using FlareScript, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (for core language development and compiling WebAssembly)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for the CLI tool and UI framework)
- A package manager like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

To get started with FlareScript:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FlareScript/FlareScript.git
    cd FlareScript
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Rust dependencies
    cargo install --path .

    # Node.js dependencies
    npm install
    ```

3. **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```

4. **Run tests:**
    ```bash
    cargo test
    ```

### Example Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can begin creating smart contracts using FlareScript’s minimal-code syntax. Here’s a simple example of a smart contract that handles token transfers:

```flarescript
contract Token {
    let balance: Map<Address, uint>

    function mint(receiver: Address, amount: uint) {
        balance[receiver] += amount
    }

    function transfer(sender: Address, receiver: Address, amount: uint) {
        require(balance[sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance")
        balance[sender] -= amount
        balance[receiver] += amount
    }
}
