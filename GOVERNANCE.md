# FlareScript Governance

## Maintainers
The FlareScript project is maintained by a core group of developers. These maintainers are responsible for reviewing code contributions, merging pull requests, and guiding the direction of the project.

### How to Become a Maintainer
Contributors who have consistently contributed high-quality code and participated in discussions may be invited to become maintainers.

## Decision-Making Process
Key decisions, such as feature additions or project direction, will be discussed openly through GitHub Discussions or community meetings. Significant changes will be voted on by core maintainers.

## How to Propose Features
To propose a new feature, please:
- Open a new issue with the label `feature request`.
- Provide a detailed description of the feature and its use cases.
- Engage in discussion with the community and maintainers.
